erlang-web-lab
==============

Playground for posting your Erlang web samples and proofs.

If you have a proof for people to solve create a directory named {proof-name} such as:
```
/hello-world/
```
... and create the specification for the proof in a README.md file 

```
/hello-world/README.md
```

If you want to contribute a solution to a proof adding a directory below the proof directory named {your twitter handle}+{webserver}+ such as:

```
/hello-world/bryan_hunter+elli/
```

Enjoy!
