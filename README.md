==============

Playground for posting your Erlang web challenges and proofs.

### Choose your weapon
Erlang is a great at building servers (including webservers), and there are many to choose from. Here are some to take a look at:

_Servers_: Webmachine, Yaws, Cowboy, Mochiweb, Elli, Inets, ...

_Frameworks_: ChicagoBoss, Erlang Web, N2O, Nitrogen, Zotonic, ...


### Defining a challenge
If you have a challenge for people to solve create a directory named {challenge-name} such as:
```
/hello-world/
```
... and create the specification for the challenge in a README.md file

```
/hello-world/README.md
```

### Contributing solutions

If you want to contribute a solution to a challenge, add a directory below the challenge directory named {your twitter handle}+{webserver}+ such as:

```
/hello-world/bryan_hunter+elli/
```

Enjoy!
