Playground for posting your Erlang web challenges and proofs.

### Choose your weapon
Erlang is a great at building servers (including webservers), and there are many to choose from. Here are some to take a look at:

_Servers_: 
* [Inets](http://erlang.org/doc/man/inets.html)
* [Yaws](http://yaws.hyber.org/)
* [Webmachine](https://github.com/basho/webmachine)
* [Mochiweb](https://github.com/mochi/MochiWeb) 
* [Cowboy](https://github.com/extend/cowboy)
* [Elli](https://github.com/knutin/elli)

_Frameworks_: 
* [ChicagoBoss](http://www.chicagoboss.org/) 
* [N2O](https://github.com/5HT/n2o)
* [Nitrogen](http://nitrogenproject.com/)
* [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix)
* [Weber](https://github.com/elixir-web/weber)
* [Zotonic](http://zotonic.com/)

### Defining a challenge
If you have a challenge for people to solve create a directory named {challenge-name} such as:
```
/hello-world/
```
... and create the specification for the challenge in a README.md file

```
/hello-world/README.md
```

### Contributing solutions

If you want to contribute a solution to a challenge, add a directory below the challenge directory named {your twitter handle}+{webserver} such as:

```
/hello-world/bryan_hunter+elli/
```

Enjoy!
