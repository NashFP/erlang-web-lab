# jorendorff+elli - A simple Web server based on Elli

My code is in the `src` directory. (I'm using this convention so that `rebar
compile` will compile the code without having to be told where it is.)

`rebar.config` here is minimal: it just tells rebar where to find Elli.

To run the server: `./run.sh`.

The first time you do this, it'll download and compile Elli.
